    <p>If you have made it to this page you hopefully already know my name is Tim Gangl. Second, you probably also know that I am a Fullstack Developer. What you may not know is that I also have a A.S. in Network Administration and love all things Tech.<br>
    I've spent most of my life working jobs in retail so my poeple skills are second to none, not to mention that I am great at leading a team or folowing intructions. So wether I am working with a team or going solo you can be sure that the job is going to get done.
    <br>In my free time I love to play music, catch concerts, and various outdoor activities. I decided to get into Web development to help further myself professionally and to use my creative side to create fun responsive content. </p>
